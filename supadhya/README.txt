Hey Ryan and Advait, this folder has all the networks that has been created for experimentation

I have just modified the step function, so that the case where the PREDATORS are all dead is also handles and the same is handled in main

What I've seen in the simulation is that, for the really deep network (30 layers, but the shape of the network can be anything), I have also seen that there is a higher chance of termination of the program (in a smaller interval of time)

In the git submit that I did this morning, no changes has been made to existing files, and all the changes that I've made to the project is in this folder.
